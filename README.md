####Credits and Acknowledgements#####
My firebase example is based on knowledge shared by
<b>Stephen Grider</b> and <b>Chris Esplin</b>.

I used Stephen's "Simple starter package for Redux with React and Babel support"
to seed my work.  I updated the UI and redux approach in my application.

I also followed the awesome Firebase tutorials created by Chris Esplin.
He's a wealth of information and it's easy to quickly code is examples.
